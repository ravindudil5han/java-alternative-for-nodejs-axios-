This script is an example of how to use Apache HttpClient to make a GET request to an HTTP server. The main purpose of this script is to retrieve data from a server at the specified URL "https://github.com/ravindudil5han/java-alternative-for-nodejs-axios-/edit/main/README.md".

In the script, first, we import the necessary libraries to use Apache HttpClient. Next, we create an instance of CloseableHttpClient, which is a class provided by Apache HttpClient to make HTTP requests.

Then, we create an instance of the HttpGet class, which represents an HTTP GET request. The HttpGet constructor takes the URL of the server we want to make a request to as an argument. We then add a header to the request with the "content-type" header set to "application/json", which specifies the format of the request data.

After that, we execute the request using the "execute" method of the CloseableHttpClient instance. This method returns an instance of HttpResponse, which represents the response of the server.

Finally, we print the response from the server using the "toString" method of the EntityUtils class. This method returns the content of the HTTP response as a string. After that, we close the CloseableHttpClient instance to free up resources.

Note: This is just an example to demonstrate the usage of Apache HttpClient and may need modifications to fit specific requirements
